IT APPEAL NO. 5332 (MUM.) OF 2015
[ASSESSMENT YEAR 2006-07]
OCTOBER  21, 2022 
Section 45 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 - Capital gains - Year in which assessable capital gains - Assessment year 2006-07 - Assessee was a director of company ASCL and assessee had given a land owned by it as collateral security as guarantor to a bank against loan taken by ASCL - Bank recalled credit facilities given to ASCL and invoked personal guarantee given by assessee - Land of assessee which was offered as collateral security by assessee to SBI was assigned to ARCIL for further sale to recover security - Accordingly, land was sold by ARCIL to company ADPL - Assessing Officer noted that market rate of land as per stamp duty valuation was at much higher amount than LTCG shown by assessee - He further brought entire amount of LTCG to tax in hands of assessee - It was noted that what was important was year in which transfer took place vis-à-vis assessee - Very fact that ARCIL was selling land as owner did indicate that transfer from assessee to ARCIL, via SBI perhaps, taken place at an earlier stage - That was year of transfer in which taxability arose so far as assessee was concerned - However, there was no categorical finding about that aspect of matter at any stage - It was also not clear as to what was date on which transfer took place from assessee to SBI and what was documentation or court/ DRT orders in this regard - This aspect of matter had simply not been examined - Whether, therefore, matter to was to be remanded back for recording a specific finding in this regard and that question of taxability of capital gains would arise only in year in which such a transfer took place - Held, yes [Para 4] [Matter remanded]
Per court : With the increasing number of cases in which recovery measures are enforced by selling properties, held by bankers and ARCs as collateral securities, it is time that the Government seriously considers protecting its legitimate interests by ensuring some mechanism to ensure that the tax liability on the capital gains is duly recovered from the borrower whose property is sold, and when it is not possible to do so on account of the borrower's genuine financial difficulties, from the person who receives the proceeds of the sale of securitized assets.
Madhur Agarwal, Fenil Bhate and Kiran Mehta for the Appellant. Shailja Rai and Manoj Sinha for the Respondent.
